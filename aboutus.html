      Hello! My name is Daniela Zarate Carabez. I'm an 18 year old web developer and my passions include education, activism, musical, partaking in the arts and doing anything creative! I had originally begun working on this project due to the inspiration of my friend Natalia Ramirez, who came up with the idea of creating a
      website dedicated to spreading accurate and easily accessible information regarding sexual education. Part of our main goal was to begin to break the stigma surrounding sex education, and create a space easily accessible for those who may be surrounded in a stigmatized environment.

    <p class="team">My passion por tech began at the young age of 12, when my dad encouranged me to change the broken screen of an old phone on my own. Although that day I didn't participate too much in the
    replacement of the screen, just seeing every little aspect that had to be taken into consideration in order to develop this excited and intrigued me.
  Now, as an 18 year old, my passion has only grown, as I have participated in the Kode With Klossy summer camp, meant to encourage young women to get involved in tech, and learn more about the
environment in said areas! After my involvement in the camp, I was inspired to begin my own club at school, meant to teach coding as more of an experience, rather than something that could be seen as tedious and tiring.
My club, called Hypertext, has begun its activities this semester, with 10 club members who are excited to learn more about the wonderful world of coding. </p>
